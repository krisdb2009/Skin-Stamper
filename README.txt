------------------------------------------
The skin stamper software is designed to be placed on a website of a server to allow users
on the server to stamp their own skin (or others) with the customizable logo or detail of
any kind created by the server (owner / admins) to be placed on the user's skins and set up a transfer to the minecraft website to change the skin.

This allows users to have pride in their server quickly and easily.

The pride stamp can be customized and even have different themes.

------------------------------------------
How to make a custom stamp!
------------------------------------------

Preferably use GIMP!

You are going to find an existing skin or make a png file with the dimensions at 64x32

Place the pixle art/stamp design over the desired area of where it would appear on a flat skin file. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING ELSE IS PURE TRANSPARENT!!!!

Try using the two example stamps to design your own.

Then save the stamp in the folder named "Stamps"

Done.

------------------------------------------
Nature of the script
------------------------------------------

It is very important to satisfy the script with whatever it needs, and what it needs is  a
php enviorment with php image capablities.

Please make sure php_gd.dll or php_gd2.dll is enabled in php extensions setup.

http://libgd.bitbucket.org/

If not please download^ them and install them! they are nessasary!


------------------------------------------
Nature of mojangs servers when script sends new skin
------------------------------------------

Mojangs servers HATE when a skin is sent over a secure protocal like https or any port other that port 80

Please use the normal protocal to satisfy mojang and their un inovated servers.


------------------------------------------
HELP!!!
------------------------------------------
Symptoms --- Solution

White screen when stamping the skin --- gd library is not installed or updated please read "nature of the script"


When users press "keep" to keep the skin desired, they are rejected by mojang's website saying "invalid link" --- Read "Nature of mojangs servers when script sends new skin" above.










Made With Love.
